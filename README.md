<h1>VPN, Honeypots, and Defenses Against IP Spoofing Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab delves into critical elements of network security, emphasizing the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), honeypots, and defenses against IP spoofing. We analyze the functionality, deployment, and effectiveness of these tools in bolstering network security. Understanding their strengths and limitations aids in constructing robust network defense strategies, crucial for safeguarding sensitive data in today's cyber threat landscape.

<h2>VPNs:</h2>
VPNs create encrypted tunnels over public networks, securing data transmission between endpoints. Encrypted data packets ensure confidentiality and integrity, mitigating eavesdropping risks. VPNs are deployed through dedicated hardware or software solutions. Tunneling protocols like IPsec, PPTP, L2TP, and SSL/TLS are commonly used. Configuration involves authentication, encryption settings, and choosing appropriate tunneling protocols. Benefits include secure remote access, privacy preservation, and circumventing geographical restrictions. However, potential limitations encompass increased latency and potential vulnerabilities in VPN protocols. 



<h2>IP Spoofing:</h2>
IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol packets with a false source IP address. This is used to impersonate another computer. Implementing ingress and egress filtering at network boundaries helps in detecting and blocking spoofed IP packets, ensuring legitimate packet flow. Utilizing strong authentication methods, like multi-factor authentication (MFA), prevents unauthorized access and reduces the risk of IP spoofing attempts. Frequent audits and active monitoring of network traffic help in identifying abnormal patterns and potential IP spoofing activities, allowing for timely mitigation.

<h2>Honeypots:</h2>
Honeypots are decoy systems designed to attract and analyze malicious activities. They mimic vulnerable systems to gather insights into attack techniques, aiding in threat intelligence. Deployment involves configuring and placing honeypots strategically within a network. Different types of honeypots, including low-interaction and high-interaction, can be utilized based on specific goals and risk tolerance. Benefits encompass threat intelligence gathering, early threat detection, and behavior analysis. However, challenges include resource consumption, maintenance efforts, and potential misuse by malicious actors.
